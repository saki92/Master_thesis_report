\chapter{Simulation Results and Evaluation}\label{ch:simulation}
In this chapter, we analyze the simulation results of our proposed techniques. We start by discussing the simulation setup. Then we analyze the plots to evaluate the performance of our techniques.

\section{Experiment Setup}
For our simulations we used the baseband system model described in section~\ref{sec:sys_mod}. The Table~\ref{tab:sim_param} lists the different parameters of the simulation setup. All the simulations are performed with these parameters unless otherwise specified in the plot captions.

\section{Evaluation of Zero-tail Termination}
In Chapter~\ref{ch:encode} we concluded that the termination for \ac{bpl} codes are performed through zero-tail termination. Here, we will evaluate the effect of zero-tail termination on the probability of error for each bit in the codeword. Figure~\ref{fig:eval_no_sat} shows the probability of error for each bit in the codeword which are calculated after being decoded by the \ac{bd}. The decoding is performed assuming that the zero-tail bits are not known at the receiver and so no effect of termination is applied on the codeword bits. Figure~\ref{fig:eval_sat} shows the probability of bits in the codeword when zero-tail bits are known at the receiver. The plots include the information bits and the parity bits but do not include the termination sequence.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{plots/eval_no_sat}
  \caption{Probability of error for information and parity bits in the codeword. Zero-tail bits are not known at the receiver. Simulation parameters are $n_i=3500$, $R_\infty=2/3$, $W=700$ and $\zeta=2$ dB.}
  \label{fig:eval_no_sat}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{plots/eval_sat}
  \caption{Probability of error for information and parity bits in the codeword. Zero-tail bits are known at the receiver. Simulation parameters are $n_i=3500$, $R_\infty=2/3$, $W=700$ and $\zeta=2$ dB.}
  \label{fig:eval_sat}
\end{figure}

With all zero-tail terminated \ac{bpl} codes, the zero-tail bits are always knows at the receiver. 
From Figure~\ref{fig:eval_sat} we can see that when zero-tail bits are know at the receiver, the decoder reduces the $P(i)$ of the information bits and parity bits in the right of the codeword. While, Figure~\ref{fig:eval_no_sat} shows that the lack of knowledge of zero-tail bits at the receiver do not reduce $P(i)$ at the end of the codeword. So, the lack of proper termination does not reduce the $P(i)$ of the bits in the right of the codeword as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:eval_no_sat} but the zero-tail termination reduces the $P(i)$ which is seen in Figure~\ref{fig:eval_sat}. Hence, zero-tail termination is an acceptable alternative to proper termination.
 
\section{Evaluation of \acl{bd}}
Here, we analyze the performance of our \ac{bd}. First we analyze the performance vs complexity over different window sizes. Figure~\ref{fig:eval_bd_bler} shows the overall \ac{bler} $P_l$ over an \ac{snr} range of $2\leq\zeta\text{ (dB)}\leq 5$ over different window sizes. Figure~\ref{fig:eval_bd_aneu} shows the \ac{aneu} over the same range of \ac{snr}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{plots/eval_bd_bler}
  \caption{\ac{bler} vs \ac{snr} of the \acl{bd} with $n_i=3500$ and $R_\infty=2/3$.}
  \label{fig:eval_bd_bler}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{plots/eval_bd_aneu}
  \caption{\ac{bler} vs \ac{snr} of the \acl{bd} with $n_i=3500$ and $R_\infty=2/3$.}
  \label{fig:eval_bd_aneu}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:eval_bd_bler} we see the \ac{bler} improves with increasing window size $W$. When the window size is increased, more \acp{vn} are included in the window enabling messaging passing over a large number of \acp{vn}. This is seen the Figure~\ref{fig:eval_bd_aneu} as higher window size has higher \ac{aneu} in the low \ac{snr} region. In high \ac{snr} region, larger window size has an advantage in improving the \ac{vn} reliability thus converging the window quicker. This is why the complexity is less compared to smaller windows in high \acp{snr}.

Figure~\ref{fig:eval_bler_rate} shows different \ac{bler} plots for all available rates $R_\infty$ for \ac{bpl} codes. It is well known that the performance of the code increases with decreasing $R_\infty$.

  \caption{\ac{bler} vs \ac{snr} of the \acl{bd} with $n_i=3500$ and $W=500$.}
  \label{fig:eval_bler_rate}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:eval_bd_iter_bler_300} and Figure~\ref{fig:eval_bd_iter_aneu_300} shows the \ac{bd} performance and complexity over different number of iterations $I$ per window. We can see that the performance of the decoder increases with increasing number of iterations because more iterations of message passing increases the reliability of the \acp{vn}. And with more iterations comes more complexity.

\end{figure}

\section{Evaluation of \acl{lrl} Decoder}
Now we compare and evaluate the performance of \ac{lrl} decoder configuration-\rom{1} with the \ac{bd}. Figure~\ref{fig:eval_bd_lrl_bler} shows two plots of \ac{bler} for \ac{bd} and \ac{lrl} decoder with window size of $W=300$. Figure~\ref{fig:eval_bd_lrl_aneu} shows two plots of \ac{aneu} for \ac{bd} and \ac{lrl} decoder with window size of $W=300$.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{plots/eval_bd_lrl_bler}
  \caption{Comparison of \ac{bler} between the Base Decoder and \ac{lrl} decoder with $W=300$.}
  \label{fig:eval_bd_lrl_bler}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{plots/eval_bd_lrl_aneu}
  \caption{Comparison of \ac{aneu} between the Base Decoder and \ac{lrl} decoder with $W=300$.}
  \label{fig:eval_bd_lrl_aneu}
\end{figure}

From both the figures, we see a significant decrease in \ac{bler} and \ac{aneu} for the \ac{lrl} decoder. The second phase of the \ac{lrl} decoder has improved the certainty of the \acp{vn} through the highly reliable \acp{vn} in the right end of the codeword. Hence, the proposed \ac{lrl} decoder is better than the \ac{bd} in terms of performance and complexity.

Figure~\ref{fig:eval_bd_lrl_bler_700} and Figure~\ref{fig:eval_bd_lrl_aneu_700} compares the performance and complexity between the \ac{bd} and \ac{lrl} decoder configuration-\rom{1} for window size $W=700$. We see that as the window size increases there is an improvement in \ac{bler} but not much decrease in the complexity. This is because with larger windows, each window converges quicker than smaller windows. So, it is more likely that not all iterations are used in the \ac{bd} and the second phase of the \ac{lrl} decoder has an advantage in decreasing \ac{bler}.

  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{plots/eval_bd_lrl_bler_700}

  \caption{Comparison of \ac{aneu} between the Base Decoder and \ac{lrl} decoder with $W=700$.}
  \label{fig:eval_bd_lrl_aneu_700}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:eval_comp_lrl_bler_300} and Figure~\ref{fig:eval_comp_lrl_aneu_300} compares the performance and complexity between the \ac{lrl} decoders configuration-\rom{1} and configuration-\rom{2}. We see that the \ac{lrl} decoder with configuration-\rom{2} yields the same \ac{bler} performance with a slightly reduced complexity. The \ac{ber} plot from Figure~\ref{fig:eval_comp_lrl_ber_300} also indicates the same. The reduced complexity is mainly because of the bottom to top \ac{cn} update in the second phase of the \ac{lrl} decoder configuration-\rom{2}. Also since the target \ac{vn} are in the right end of the window, the window converges faster than the configuration-\rom{1} decoder.

\section{Evaluation of \acl{ipsc} Technique}
Here, we evaluate the performance of our \ac{ipsc} technique. Figure~\ref{fig:eval_ipsc_bler_300} and Figure~\ref{fig:eval_ipsc_aneu_300} compares the performance and complexity between the \ac{bd} with different early-success criteria with $W=300$. Similarly, Figure~\ref{fig:eval_ipsc_bler_600} and Figure~\ref{fig:eval_ipsc_aneu_600} compares for $W=600$.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \caption{Comparison of \ac{aneu} between different early-success criteria with $W=600$.}
  \label{fig:eval_ipsc_aneu_600}
\end{figure}

From the Figures~\ref{fig:eval_ipsc_bler_300}, \ref{fig:eval_ipsc_aneu_300}, \ref{fig:eval_ipsc_bler_600} and \ref{fig:eval_ipsc_aneu_600} we see that for $W\geq2(m_s+1)$, checking only the target \acp{cn} as early-success criteria decreases the decoding complexity.
