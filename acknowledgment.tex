\chapter*{Acknowledgment}
This work represents the results of the six-month Master’s thesis project carried out at Intel Deutschland GmbH, Nuremberg in cooperation with Bioinspired Communication Systems Lab at Technische Universität Darmstadt.

First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor Janik Frenzel, M.Sc. and his supervisor Dr.-Ing. Stefan M\"uller-Weinfurtner for having faith in me and give me this wonderful opportunity. I would like to also thank my supervisor at the university Bastian Alt, M.Sc. and the head of the group Prof. Dr. techn. Heinz K\"oppl for accepting my thesis work done at Intel Deutschland GmbH.

Especially, I would like to thank Janik Frenzel for introducing me to the field of LDPC codes with a practical and industrial perspective. The several discussions we had during this project certainly improved my insights into the topic and helped to overcome the ambiguities in my understanding. I greatly appreciate his patience and efforts to answer my questions as well as to review this work.

Special thanks to my family and friends in India for providing moral support. Without them, this work would not have been possible.
