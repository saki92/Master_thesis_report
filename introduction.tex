\chapter{Introduction}
\glspl{ldpccc} are a class of linear block codes which are widely used in data transmission and storage systems. \glspl{ldpccc} are proven to be better than \glspl{ldpcbc} because of their convolutional nature and the infinitely long codeword. With terminated codes, \gls{ldpccc} are comparable to \gls{ldpcbc} if the codeword length is large. Along side the code performance, the \gls{ldpccc} have an advantage in its decodability. Its convolutional structure allows for window decoding instead of full block decoding. However with window decoding, there is always a trade-off between decoding latency and decoding performance.

\glspl{ldpccc} are applications like used in \gls{bpl} (IEEE 1901) and \gls{wimax} (IEEE 802.16) standards to name a few. In more widely used applications like mobile telephony (New Radio) and wireless \gls{lan}, so far \gls{ldpcbc} are being used. But due to the better performance and increasing popularity of \gls{ldpccc}, they are more likely to be used in large number of applications in the future.

There are quite some amount of window decoding algorithms that are proposed in recent years. One of them is the \emph{Zigzag decoder} that was proposed by Abu-Surra in~\cite{Shadi2015}. This decoder moves the window forward and backward in small part of the \gls{pcm}. Another decoder proposed in~\cite{Kang2018} used a technique to reduce the error propagating from left to right of the \gls{pcm} as the window moves. Three more improvement techniques for window decoder are proposed in~\cite{Ali2018} which are discussed in later chapters. The aforementioned decoding techniques either use flooding schedule or are evaluated with \gls{bec}. We are interested in serial scheduling and \gls{awgn} channel.

In this thesis, we propose a \gls{lrl} decoder with two configurations and an \gls{ipsc} technique. The \gls{lrl} decoder which is motivated by the Zigzag decoder moves the window forward and backward. The \gls{ipsc} is an improvement over \gls{psc} proposed in~\cite{Kang2018}. We also investigate the termination problem in the \gls{ldpccc} used in the standard IEEE 1901. We evaluate the proposed techniques with an \gls{awgn} channel system model.

The organization of this thesis is as follows. Chapter~\ref{ch:back} contains the theory of channel coding and channel codes with an emphasis on \gls{ldpccc}. We also discuss the system model used for our simulations. In Chapter~\ref{ch:encode}, we discuss the termination problem in IEEE 1901's \gls{ldpccc}. We then discuss the proposed decoding techniques and their evaluation in Chapters~\ref{ch:dec_improve} and \ref{ch:simulation} respectively. Finally in Chapter~\ref{ch:conclu}, we conclude our findings during the evaluation of our techniques and discuss about possible future works.
