In this work, techniques to improve the performance of window based decoder for \gls{ldpccc} are developed. In order to evaluate the performance of our techniques, we choose the codes from the standard IEEE 1901. Our focus is on terminated \gls{ldpccc} and so we first investigate the termination mechanism in the encoder. We found that a proper end-termination for the IEEE 1901's \glspl{ldpccc} is infeasible. Two improvement techniques for window decoders are developed and evaluated. The first technique focuses on the movement direction of the window in which the window starts and ends at the same position in the \gls{pcm}. Two different configurations of the first technique are discussed. The second improvement technique focuses on the early-success criteria for window termination where a dynamic criteria that changes based on window size. The simulations are carried on an \gls{awgn} channel based system model. The first technique is proved to have better decoding performance at a reduced deocding complexity. The second technique has a reduced complexity with about the same performance as the decoder without the technique.
